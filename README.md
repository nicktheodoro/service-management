# Service Management API

## Overview

This API provides a foundation for managing services within Golang applications. It's currently in its initial stage, with a simple "Hello World" endpoint to demonstrate its structure and functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/service-management-api.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/go-playground/pure/v5
   go get -u github.com/go-playground/pure/v5/_examples/middleware/logging-recovery
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Testing the API

1. Access the "Hello World" endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3007
   ```

   This should return the message "Hello World".
